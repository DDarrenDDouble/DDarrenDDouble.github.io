        another hour to find the right building and another 30 minutes to<br>
        find stairs and another 15 minutes to find the right room. this course<br>
        is called intro to python so tell me why  there a kid in here who has 7 years of<br>
        coding experience and is in a robitics team? that is literally the complete<br>
        opposite of this course name. he paid 5000 dollars to be here just to smurf<br>
        of some iron python kids like get a life you nerd no one likes you.

        you absolute destroy 9 year olds on roblox, but ngl it just takes a bunch of stress off<br>
        ur shoulders cus you dont have to worry about people looking at your screen<br>
